        <h1>About this Video</h1>
        <p>This promotional video highlights the BackTrack App, a tool designed to rediscover Ireland's forgotten historical sites. The app focuses on places like abandoned mansions and other hidden landmarks, with a hint of mystery and adventure. The video was filmed at Cullane House, a historic and eerie location, perfect for the app's theme. The logo, featuring red and black, reflects the thrilling and spooky vibe of the project.
        </p>

      <p>To create the video, we first visited the location for a trial shoot to test ideas and explore the spot. On the main filming day, we arrived early to capture everything in daylight before dark in the winter evening. The result is a mix of adventure and creativity, bringing the concept of the app to life.
